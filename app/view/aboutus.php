        This is a budget blogspot, where anyone and everyone can write down what they feel like writing like a personal blog but at the same time, you can follow other people's blog and read what they write which is something like facebook where you can like and comment but it's more like personal blog type of website where you can just express what you want to let anyone to read it.
